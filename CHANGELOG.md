## [5.1.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Added standard MCP protocol initialization response metadata matching `v5.1.0` server capabilities.

### Changed
- **Inline Self-Review**: Replaced heavyweight subagent review loops (Spec Review, Plan Review) in `brainstorming` and `writing-plans` with lightweight inline self-review checklists, reducing execution time overhead.
- **Git Worktree Redesign**: Rewrote `using-git-worktrees` and `finishing-a-development-branch` with a `detect-and-defer` mechanism, prioritizing native AI editor tools (such as Claude Code's `EnterWorktree`) and safely falling back to git CLI commands.
- **Token Footprint Optimization**: Removed obsolete `Integration` sections from all skills, reducing prompt token usage during agent execution.
- **Agent Consolidation**: Merged the independent `code-reviewer` agent directly into `requesting-code-review` skill templates.

### Removed
- Removed legacy slash commands (`/brainstorm`, `/execute-plan`, `/write-plan`) in favor of standard MCP tool invocation.
